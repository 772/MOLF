# MOLF
MOLF stands for Mail-based Open Limited Freigeld. The idea was to create a monetary system that fits into one small .php file that everybody understands.

Pros
- The negatve interest rates prevents people to get grazy amounts of money on cost of others.
- The systen/program is so easy that really everybody understands it.
- No registration and no accounts needed.

Cons:
- The php site and the mailserver must be trusted. Ideally each German city has its own mail server and is providing one mail to each human living there. It should be impossible to have several e-mails.
